===============================================================================

This plugin add the shortcut "config" to CCFE, so it can be invoked with the
command "ccfe config".
With this plugin you can intercatively edit

- CCFE Global configuration files
  (usually /etc/ccfe/ccfe.conf) and optionally Fn keys labels definitions in
  CCFE messages file (usually /usr/share/ccfe/msg/C/msg).

- CCFE User private configuration files
  ($HOME/.ccfe/ccfe.conf)

To see your configuration changes, you have to exit from CCFE and run it again.
You can also use this plugin to configure CCFE instances.


CCFE FEATURES USED:
- Field initialization by init{} block.
- Notifications of errors detected during form initiaization.
- init{} block checks that user has correct access permissions to configuration
  files before post form to edit them.
- Parameters passing from menu to form (so it needs CCFE >= 1.57)
- Parameters passing from form to form

    Form changes if user requested Fn keys label editing
    Form changes if user edit a new configuration file
    Form changes if user edit a private configuration file
- Example of forms containing informational text.

NOTES:
- This plugin is a beta release.
- Before change a configuration file, this plugin backup it with extension
  DayOfYear-HHMMSS.
- Until CCFE 1.56, default global configuration file includes some
  terminal-dependent settings, so you can edit it by setting the field
  "Ignore terminal-dependent settings reading file" to "YES".

  add or change the "load_user_objects" parameter to "YES" in the
